The main topic is about virtual private cloud  . How it advantages , where we can say that virtual cloud can be mini internet with in the internet . It is highly secured in AWS as it is has provides public
instances. where every organization donot want tos how there instances or virtual servers with in their same common servers for every one . So it came with an concept of virtual server 
where in this virtual private cloud the security is high
here it splits the ip addresses where we can say it as spiltting of ip address as subnetting next in this there few  security concepts
!.internet gate way
2.NACL(Network Access control Lists)
3.Load Balancer
4.Route tables
5.security
there is divided into private subnetes and public subnets
In this we are using public subnets where  every can use it if they enters to network gateway
now, create an vpc create new check all the configurations check in vpc settings and click on vpc and more
next, create an instance in networking with security setting ass vpn there it slraedy give default vpc but add the new one you created and enable public ip address
next launch instance
now connect throught instance and try with python3
open the terminal or mobaexterm terminal or putty 
use cmd : ssh -i <filename> ubuntu@ipaddress eg:ssh -i new_learning ubuntu@54.84.144.232
get into theinsatnce
after this upadate  cmd: sudo apt update # it is a gud practice to update
next install eg: python3
next use the cmd: python3 -m http.server 8000
next go to the browser and check: http://54.84.144.232:8000/  # it will does not connect as even  VPC(NACL) network gateway gave all the permission default security groups doesn't allow
so we need to go to the instances there in security<inbound rules<edit inbound rules<allow permission for port number 8000
now it will give output:Directory listing for /
.bash_logout
.bashrc
.cache/
.profile
.python_history
.ssh/
.sudo_as_admin_successful
.Xauthority
# the above code will be displayed
now, what about VPC, even the security groups allow (security groups only defaulty have permissions to allow) but vpc can able to deny even after security groups allow
open the vpc network setting <inbound rules < deny
here it follows asending order wher lowest number order is followed
for eg: we firsty tabe 100 number and allow all the permissions and take 200 number deny permission . It follows first 100 only
